# XMLtoCSVParser

## !!!This is an old project and the code has not been updated to work with the newest Java version!!!

## Aim of the project
This program helps combine multiple XML-files with different structures into one CSV file.
It was created to process XML-records from different hospitals which all had a similar structure but differed slightly.

## How to use
After launching the program, select all XML files you wish to process.
Then, for each one select the nodes to be exported. The program will try to match differently structured XML files.
You can use the settings to select how the matching method.

Once all XMLs have been processed you can export them as a CSV file. You can also save the structure of the export.
This is useful if you want to export similar XML files in the future according to the same export rules.
